Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is the client, and they sought to modernize their operations and enhance the security of their web-based software application. They wanted to protect their organization from external threats and ensure the security of their customers' financial information. The main issues they wanted to address included unauthorized access, data breaches, injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and insecure communications.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
During the vulnerability assessment, I successfully identified and documented security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's codebase. By conducting a manual review and static testing, I discovered vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). It is important to code securely because secure coding practices help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities and protect sensitive data. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall wellbeing by safeguarding customer information, maintaining customer trust, avoiding financial losses from breaches, ensuring regulatory compliance, and protecting the reputation of the organization.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The manual review and static testing were both helpful in identifying vulnerabilities. However, the challenging part was ensuring that all potential vulnerabilities were thoroughly evaluated and documented. It required a comprehensive understanding of security best practices and a meticulous examination of the codebase and associated dependencies.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, I recommended implementing parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, implementing output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and regularly updating third-party libraries to mitigate known vulnerabilities. In the future, I would use a combination of manual code reviews, static analysis tools, dynamic testing tools, and penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities. The choice of mitigation techniques would depend on the specific vulnerabilities discovered and the best practices and recommendations available for addressing them.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were both functional and secure, I conducted a manual review and static testing. After refactoring the code to address the identified vulnerabilities, it is crucial to conduct thorough testing, including functional testing, security testing, and regression testing. This helps ensure that the code changes did not introduce new vulnerabilities and that the application remains stable, functional, and secure. It is also important to involve peer code reviews and quality assurance processes to catch any potential issues.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In this vulnerability assessment, I used manual code review techniques, static analysis tools (dependency-check plug-in integrated into Maven), and security best practices such as input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries, and prepared statements. These resources, tools, and coding practices are applicable and beneficial in future assignments or tasks related to security assessments, secure coding, and vulnerability mitigation.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
